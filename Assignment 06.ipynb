    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where different components of a computer program are modeled after real-world objects. An object is anything that has some characteristics and can perform a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where you have to develop a Formula 1 car racing game using the object-oriented programming approach. The first thing you need to do is to identify real-world objects in the actual Formula 1 race. What are the entities in a Formula 1 race that have some characteristics and can perform any function? One of the obvious answers to this question is the car. A car can have characteristics like engine capacity, make, model, manufacturer, and so on. Similarly, a car can be started, stopped, accelerated and so on. A driver can be another object in a Formula 1 race. A driver has a nationality, age, gender, and so on, and he can perform functionalities like driving the car, moving the steering or changing the transmission.\n",

    "1. Object-oriented programming fosters reusability. A computer program is written in the form of objects and classes, which can be reused in other projects as well.\n",
    "2. The modular approach used in object-oriented programming results in highly maintainable code.\n",
    "3. In object-oriented programming, every class has a specific task. If an error occurs in one part of the code, you can rectify it locally without having to affect other parts of the code.\n",

    "1. Class\n",
    "A class in object-oriented programming serves as a blueprint for the object. A class can be considered as a map for the house. You can get an idea of what the house looks like by simply seeing the map. However, a class itself is nothing. For instance, a map is not a house, it only explains how the actual house will look.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object\n",
    "An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and properties to make a particular type of data useful. Object determines the behavior of the class. When you send a message to an object, you are asking the object to invoke or execute one of its methods.\n",

    " A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do anything to themselves or have anything done to them."
